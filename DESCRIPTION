Description: Validates estimates of (conditional) average treatment effects obtained using observational data by a) making it easy to obtain and visualize estimates derived using a large variety of methods (G-computation, inverse propensity score weighting, etc.), and b) ensuring that estimates are easily compared to a gold standard (i.e., estimates derived from randomized controlled trials). 'RCTrep' offers a generic protocol for treatment effect validation based on four simple steps, namely, set-selection, estimation, diagnosis, and validation. 'RCTrep' provides a simple dashboard to review the obtained results. The validation approach is introduced by Shen, L., Geleijnse, G. and Kaptein, M. (2023) <doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-2559287/v2>.
